# PROGRAMME drift watch — side-lane mandate from Magnus, 2026-08-09 ~17:0x CEST

**Magnus, directly, in the side-lane session:** *"Can you make sure we don't
drift from that? I can't keep track on the builder."* — "that" being the
programme loop he'd just had restated: iterate Loki planks, test tricks on
pre-registered unrated legs, keep what measures, lean into what kills inside
r250, Eir frozen as slot-holder.

This widens the side lane per two-session-protocol rule 5 (only Magnus can
widen a lane). The lane's other constraints are unchanged: **no verdicts, no
bot edits, no arena, no HANDOVER/tape writes.** A drift flag is a note or ping,
never a veto; escalation path is flag → builder, and if unresolved →
PushNotification to Magnus.

## The drift checklist (each item anchored to a PROGRAMME.md field or a Magnus directive)

Checked against every commit landing in the repo (session monitor, all
commits) and at every verdict/ship/leg event:

| # | drift signature | anchor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | a plank built outside the Loki lineage dirs, or any edit to the frozen incumbent beyond rollback | `LINE: loki`, `INCUMBENT_FROZEN: yes` |
| D2 | a battery or verdict measured against Eir (or any non-Loki baseline) instead of the previous Loki iteration | `COMPARE_AGAINST: previous_line_iteration` |
| D3 | a verdict argued from win rate | `WIN_RATE_IS_VERDICT: no`; currencies are `core_kill_share` + `time_to_core_kill` |
| D4 | a plank or objective aimed at surviving/clock-playing rather than killing inside the window (the struck "r1000 alive" pivot returning in any costume) | `KILL_WINDOW_RND: 250`; Magnus 16:04 correction |
| D5 | an unrated leg fired without a pre-registration locked (committed) BEFORE leg creation | Magnus "test theories using unrated games"; the 2m33s two-clock standard |
| D6 | a leg's result banked without autopsy against its pre-registered bar, or an off-prediction win banked as confirmation | loss-autopsy-method; PREREG obligations 1–9 |
| D7 | a line-mix (Loki features ported onto Eir or vice versa) | PROGRAMME: "_v116thor is the last instance" |
| D8 | the programme declared over by anything other than Magnus's word or the curve crossing + ladder read | PROGRAMME exit conditions |
| D9 | a "LOKI delta vs baseline" quoted without per-opponent Ns | obligation 8 |
| D10 | a mechanism metric substituted for the currency in verdict language | obligation 5's anti-Goodhart sentence |

## Standing notes

- `tools/gate.py` already refuses off-programme **batteries** (D1/D2 at
  battery time). The watch covers what gate.py cannot see: verdict wording,
  unrated legs, ships, objective drift in docs and plans.
- The watch covers ALL THREE LANES including this one — my own docs are
  checked against D4/D9/D10 the same way (this lane has already had to strike
  its own r1000 hold once).
- False-positive policy: flag cheaply and early; a wrong flag costs a
  one-line reply, a missed drift costs a session. The builder is expected to
  answer flags with the anchor, not with compliance.
- **Transferability is not field behaviour (research, 17:4x, adopted as a
  standing watch note):** every tactics-sweep file ends in a transferability
  verdict against OUR ruleset; it is easy to slide from "this transfers" to
  "this is what our field does". Different claims, different evidence — the
  second needs a corpus measurement (first made 2026-08-09: our field's CAD
  and KCM use launchers 88–94% as offensive ferries, the opposite of the
  BC2020 doctrine our own bot follows). Watch for doctrine statements citing
  a sweep where the claim is actually about opponents' behaviour.
- This document is the mandate's durable record. A successor side-lane session
  boots into it via the coordination tail and MEMORY.
