"""Fail loudly on corpus columns that are silently dead.

WHY: corpus/econ.tsv has a `shots` column that is 0 in all 25,530 rows --
replay_econ.py declares it and then does `elif unum == 12: pass`. Every OTHER
column in that file is populated, so the zero does not look like a bug, it
looks like a FINDING. Anyone asking the corpus "how often do we fire?" gets 0
and could reasonably conclude we never shoot. (The live data is in
build_agg.tsv under metric == 'shot'.)

An all-zero numeric column is either a real fact about the game or a decoder
that never fired. It is never safe to assume which.

Usage:  .venv/bin/python tools/corpus_sanity.py [corpus_dir]
